# 🧠 Comparative Data Analysis on Student Mental Health: India vs Japan

This project is created by **Piyush Chettry**, an aspiring Cognitive Science and Psychology researcher from India.  
It explores the **relationship between academic pressure, sleep duration, happiness index, and productivity** among students in **India and Japan**, highlighting how **mental health and academic efficiency differ across cultures**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze and visualize how academic pressure and social environments affect students' well-being, productivity, and happiness.  
This study aims to emphasize the need for **mental health awareness and balanced education systems** — a key area of focus for future research in **Cognitive and Behavioral Sciences**.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset `Student_Mental_Health_India_vs_Japan.csv` contains:
- **Country:** India or Japan  
- **Sleep Hours:** Average hours of sleep per day  
- **Academic Pressure (1–10):** Reported stress level from studies  
- **Happiness Index (1–10):** Self-reported happiness score  
- **Productivity Score (1–100):** Measured academic performance  
- **Mental Health Score (1–100):** Overall mental well-being score  

---

## 🧩 Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** for data processing  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** for analysis  

---

## 📈 Visual Insights
The notebook visualizes:
- Country-wise mental health comparison  
- Correlation heatmaps between stress, sleep, and productivity  
- Scatter plots showing happiness vs academic pressure  
- Mean comparison of productivity and happiness across countries  

---

## 🌍 Key Findings
- Japanese students maintain **higher productivity and mental balance** despite moderate pressure,  
  suggesting strong **social and institutional support systems**.  
- Indian students show **higher academic stress** with comparatively lower happiness scores,  
  likely influenced by **competitive educational pressures**.  
- Positive mental health correlates strongly with **better sleep and lower stress** in both countries.
